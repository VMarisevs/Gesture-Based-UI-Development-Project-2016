### How to run
#### Online Kinect game

To run this sample you have to install:
- [Unity Web Player](http://webplayer.unity3d.com/download_webplayer-3.x/UnityWebPlayer.exe)
- [ZigFu Web Player](http://zigfu.com/en/downloads/browserplugin/)

And then you can run **Kinect V1** + **Unity** games in your browser.

This project was poster in my portfolio website [http://flappybird3d.vmarisevs.me/](http://flappybird3d.vmarisevs.me/)

#### Unity v5.3.2f1
To run this project you need:
- [Unity v5.3.2f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
- *Kinect V1*

Simply open this project using *Unity*.

### How to play
#### Menu

Menu keeps a track of users right hand and if he holds more that 1.5 sec on the button, then it will be clicked. To come back from options or high score tab use left hand to swipe from left to right.

#### Game

Game is very simple, user must flap to keep flying and fly as far as possible.

### How it was implemented

Difficulties with this project started from installing [the ZDK or ZigFu Development Kit](http://zigfu.com/en/zdk/overview/). Unity has been updated too many times and libraries has been changed since this driver was developed, so I spend good few hours to fix this issues and start reviewing given samples.
